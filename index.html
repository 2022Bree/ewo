                                    1. Volunteerism; We believe in doing good unto others, to offer ourselves in making the lives of other people better, not out of abundance of our possession but through a self-driven desire to make the lives of the vulnerable meaningful and of dignity.
                                    2. Youth engagement; we value the participation and meaningful engagement of young people not only as beneficiaries but as catalysts of change ideas in communities. 
                                    3. Innovations; we value creativity in solving complex issues that affects the social and economic well-being of communities that we serve.
                                    4. Excellence and Integrity; we proudly do what we have to do, in the best way possible and with great sense of pride and passion. We deliver the best from ourselves, in the most honest way possible. 
                                    5. Inclusion and participation: We serve humanity irrespective of their race, religion, gender or political affiliations.  
                                    6. Diversity – We recognize, respect and value the differences among us and believe that acknowledging and celebrating these differences lead to strengthened social capital.
